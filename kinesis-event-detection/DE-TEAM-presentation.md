### Data engineering team FAS-Marketing


## Introduction


FAS-DE is a small team of people fully commited to help other team members in their daily job, making their lifes easier and reducing some heavy lifting activities that sometimes are not
directly part of the role for which they were hired.
The main functionality of a repository is to build and maintain code, however , as a team we would like to go beyond that and cover some extra topics that might be useful for the team,
such as:

* **Promotion and education** on the job we do as Data Engineers.
* **Build and maintain general** purpose DE-code, which may be leverage by other team members.
* **Awareness for team members** about skills/knowledge that DE members are building, that can be leverage to enhance current project or to start new ones.



## Our role as Data Engineers

Data engineers have several responsabilities starting from data acquisition/maintenance, until a final consumable data that can be leveraged by Analysts or BI users. Functionalities are:

1- Build data systems and pipelines.
2- Prepare data for prescriptive and predictive modeling.

3- Combine raw information from different sources.

4- Explore ways to enhance data quality and reliability.

5- Identify opportunities for data acquisition.

6- Develop analytical tools and programs.

7- Collaborate with data scientists/analysts and architects on several projects.

8- Automate reports and dashboards.


## How can we help the team?

Based on our data engineer tasks and the current status of Vanguard and the FAS-marketing team, there are several ways in which we can help our team members

1- As data increases faster than computing technologies traditional processing has found some issues when dealing with bigdata, that is the reason why cluster computing
   became so relevant nowadays. If you have a process struggling with the amount of data process we can help!!. The following procces are likely to be migrated.

	* Slow performance python codes.
	* Redpoint tasks.

2- Any task that is executed more than two times is likely to be automated in order to save time for users, so users can really focus on what matters to them!!. Below are some
   of the tasks that are likely to be automated:

	* Data gathering.
	* Dashboard refresh.
	* Reports.

3- Find new datasets and make its information available for team members.
	
	* Find and prepare new datasets such as 3rd party data or data within other vanguard teams.
	* Enrichment of current datasets.

4- Create automated ETL processes in order to enable dataset to be easily consumable by team team members.


5- Make datasets highly available and easily consumable for team members.

	* Store and maintain data on AWS.
	* Act as SPOC in case of dataset/databases resources available.
	

**Regardless the prior information, if you find any project opportunity that is suitable for the FAS-DE team do not hesitate and contact us!!!**.

## Next DE releases

FAS-DE team is constantly learning new market trend skills as well as requiring more sailpoint roles in order to help the team to solve their issues with the latest
resources and technologies available, that is the reason why in the short term the DE-team will be able to:
